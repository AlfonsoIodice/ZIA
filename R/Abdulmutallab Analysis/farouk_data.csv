body,views,replies,title,time,date,id"Assalamu Alaykum brothers and sisters,Ihave several dilemmas i want to get out of and this has made me lonely.As i intent to write a lot, i suggest for anyone who gets board of mylong desperate talk to just read the bit they can and advise me even itis just a sentence. I will find it very beneficail and comforting toget help from muslim brothers and sisters. Firstly i willstart with a bit of my background and then the dilemmas. I am aboarding student in a school with few muslims. For some years now, ihav been doing some da'wah, mainly enjoining good and forbiding evil,and jihadinnafs, trying to become closer to Allah. But i have beenfacing several problems.First of all, i have no friend. Notbecause i do not socialise, etc but because either people do not wantto get too close to me as they go partying and stuff while i dont, orthey are bad people who befriend me and influence me to do bad things.Hence i am in a situation where i do not have a friend, i have no oneto speak too, no one to consult, no one to support me and i feeldepressed and lonely. i do not know what to do. And then ithink this loneliness leads me to other problems. As i get lonely, thenatural sexual drive awakens and i struggle to control it, sometimesleading to minor sinful activities like not lowering the gaze. Andthis problem makes me want to get married to avoid getting aroused. TheProphet (S) advised young men to fast if they cant get married but ithas not been helping me much and i seriously dont want to wait foryears before i get married. But i am only 18, (just going touniversity, insha Allah in London or California). i have not startedsearching for prospective partners because It would be difficult for meto get married due to social norms of getting to the late 20's when onehas a degree, a job, a house, etc before getting married, plus parentsare relunctunt to give their daughters in marriage to an 18 year oldand sisters are also not normally willing to marry an 18 year old.Anyway alhamdulillah my parents i know could help me financially shouldi get married, even though i think they are also not going to be infavour of early marriage.The last thing i want to talk about ismy dilemma between liberalism and extremism. The Prpphet (S) saidreligion is easy and anyone who tries to overburden themselves willfind it hard and will not be able to continue. So anytime i relax, ideviate sometimes and then when i strive hard, i get tired of what i amdoing i.e. memorising the quran, etc. How should one put the balanceright?Thank you for anyone whoo reaches this stage of readingmy problem. May Allah reward you for reading and reward you more forhelping.

I amglad you seek to solve your problem by asking fellow muslims foradvise. That is the best way forward for the best advise is thataccording to the quran and sunnah. i encourage you to get marriedbecause the prophet (S) said marriage is half the dee, the other halfis to control your tongue. My advice to you is to tell her anddo Al-istikhara prayer, prayer asking Allah for guidance for what todo. Imagine getting married and not being trusted by your wife and herfamily and friends? So eventhough telling her your real age might endthe marriage plans, your better off. But most likely if she loves youand she is religious, and you show her you have repented, then yourmarriage should still go ahead. Our prophet married Khadija who was15years older than he was and it was a perfect and ideal marriage, with6 children.Insha Allah i will find more time to talk to you.Ma'assalamBrother Farouk.Please tell me how your doing, the outcome and any comments or remarks you have.",667,18,Im Such An Idiot!,8:37:00,1/29/05,2"Salam Alaykum sister,Niceto hear you want to learn about the deen.

Youknow, loneliness in religion is not only encounted by reverts andconverts to Islam, but also by muslims who are trying their best topractice their deen, because honestly many muslims are just muslims byname and the ones who actually practice thier religion ernestly are avery few. Sad but true i believe.So brother, i can tell youyour not alone, i myself (originally in a muslim country and schoolingelsewhere with several muslims) have met hundreds of muslims butfinding no good friend.I'm sure people have been telling you totalk to ur family, i also advise you to do the same. Reach to them,express how you love them and miss them, tell them how you find comfortwith Islam, the true religion. Also realise that your goingthrough a test and Allah will be with you if you remember him, stick toyour deen no matter what. Insha Allah you will find comfort and mayAllah help you and be with you. AmeenMa'assalamPlease tell us how it goes with you. You are always welcome.",375,8,I'm Just Floating Along,20:52:00,1/29/05,5"Assalamu alaykum brother,Iam new to IF and when i first came here, i thought i was the onlylonely soul. But after, i realised that almost every good muslim getslonely at some point. This i believe is because really there are manymuslims but most are just muslims by name who do not practice the deenernestly, leaving the few good muslims alone. So its a test we have tostrive and go through for the sake of Allah.As for me, i hopeto get over my loneliness when i go to university or college inshaAllah very soon where there are usually islamic groups clubs with goodmuslims. I am not yet a full member, but insha Allah when i do become afull member in IF, then i will get good brother's contacts and chatwith them on MSN. That i think can help a lot for anybody who is lonely.Youknow with marrige, again good muslims are struggling to find goodpartners due to the society we live in. A good way to find a goodpartner is i believe to go to masjids you trust, inquire for muslimsistrs who also want to get married. Also ask any good muslim friendsand family members to help you find a good prospective partner. I dontadvise you to use an online matrimonial, even if it is islamiceventhough there could be good prospective partners, it is hard to findthem.I also wwant to get married bu i am having problems. Iwill love to discuss this topic with you on MSN, if you wish , you cansend me an email.Ma'assalam. I will love to know how your doing.",479,18,I Need A Quick Answer Please  Inshallah,21:24:00,1/29/05,6"Assalamu Alaykum sister,Youare welcome to this forum full of good and caring muslims. You as itold someone, i realise that all good muslims are lonely at some pointin thier lives. Why? well because most of the muslims around are justmuslim by name and do not sincerely practice their religion. Hence thefew good muslims are left lonely. I am lonely too sister, you know. Icannot find good muslim friends and i just have to try my best to findcomfort by getting closer to Allah. Even the prophet (S) was lonelywhen Khadija and Abu Talib passed away. So loneliness is a trial fromAllah that we have to try and endure without deviating from thestraight path and sinning.Marriage has now become a big problemin the muslim community. The prophet (S) has said it, his words areever true. He said if you find a prospective partner whose religion andcharacter you are happy with, then get your schildren married or elsewe will have problems in the ummah. And as a scholar said, now peopleset up a demanding criteria for prospective partners making it moredifficult to find a match because ideal partners dont really exist. Forexample one will say, my partner must be religious and have a goodcharacter (that's good), but then the list also includes things like,the partner must be good looking, a certain skin complexion, a certaintribe, speaks a certain language, lives in a certain country, has acertain job, must be 2 years older or younger...(people's list go onforever, i have even heard ridiculous ones like the partner must have adimple on the cheek!)i dont advise you to use matrimonials. ithink there are always bad people who present themselves as good peoplebut aren't. Also its so unreal i think. Eventhough one mightbe shy, i think good ways of finding partners is to ask family andfriends to find you one and inquire for good partners for you. Alsopeople looking for partners frequently go to masjids so one couldinquire about them or inquire throught the imam, or through somebody.That'swhat i have to say, if you still want to ask for specific advice orhelp, you are always welcome. There are good people that will help youin IF.Please also tell us in IF how it goes with you. Itencourages people who give advice tom keep on putting in the effortknowing the results of their efforts, whether succesful or not.Ma'assalam",368,9,Sorry..but I Want 2 Get Married...,19:30:00,1/30/05,7"Assalamu alaykum sister,Itis really sad to hear about muslims going through such ordeals. MayAllah help you, guide you, recompense you and be with you. AmeenTheprophet (S) said The mother should be given 3 times more care andcompanionship than the father. Nevertheless the father should also betreated as a parent.So whatever you do, try not to hurt yourmother, but i think try and involve some wise relatives, wise imams inyour area, etc to talk to your mother about what best should be done.If you think you can, i think it will even be better that you expressto your mother how you feel, what you want and so on, of course not ina way that will make her angry. You need to get married. Theprophet (S) said marriage is half the deen and the other half is thatyou watch your tongue (what you say and eat). This will bring happinessto your life as well as for your mother and will not make you and yourfamily lonely. Choosing a husband taht is religious and has a goodcharacter is the basis of all lasting and happy relations. All otherthings should not be given as much importance.Please tell ushow it goes. Its nice to know what happens to the person who advice hasbeen given to.

Are you hanging around with a group of friends who do not likestudying? Hang around with good muslims, and students who enjoystudying.Please tell us how it goes.

AmeenItis very sad to hear your situation and the ordeals you are goingthrough. It's a pity that muslims go through these kind of situations.Your problem is very complex. I recommend you submit your counsellingproblrm to professional muslim counsillors at www.islamonline.net Myadvice to you is not to go through this alone. Talk to your family andtrusted friends. Try your best to work with your husband, his family orrelatives or friends and your family or friends or relative, and maybea wise imam you know and trust. Try and work to make this marriagework. Even though there might be problems if this marriage continues, ibelieve there could be more problems if the marriage doesn't work, thewhole divorce, finding another partner, financially taking care ofyourself, the emotional drawbacks (because you do love him) and so on.As has been referred in the quran, if both parties honestly work tosolve the problem, and want to solve the problem, then by Allah's leaveeverything will be fine.Do salatul istikharah on this andinvoke Allah a lot about it. As a scholar said, if you have a problem,invoke Allah like a small child or baby. Cry if you have to and keepinvoking Allah till He yields results for you. Indeed Allah, he is everwatchful, ever present, knows exactly what you are going through, lovesthat you invoke him, He is ever generous, forgiving and merciful andwill do what you believe He can do for you.

I hopr thatyou get to marry her if it is the best for both of you. Ameen.IfAllah wills this marriage will take place, there is nothing and no onethat can stop it happening, and if Allah wills it will not happen,there would be nothing that will make it happen, even if the wholeworld were to plead for you.

So takecomfort with Allah.Usually parents dont like marriages betweendifferent ethnic groups for various reasons, i.e. they feel their tribeis superior, they think the marrige will not work out and don't wanttheir children hurt in the process. So on a practical level, by carefulwisdom and planning, involve friends, relatives, family members, localimams that could convince all parties that any marriage will work aslong as the partners are religious and have good character.Dontmake the situation worse by keeping contact with the girl. You willcome to realise that keeping contact will not make the situation anybetter.This is the time and age when muslims from differentethnic groups are coming together and marriges between them arebecoming more frequent. Understandably, parents who find it new arereluctunt about it. But we the next generation insha Allah will grow,we understand the situation better, and in the future insha Allah, thiswill no more be a problem in the muslim ummah. It wasn't a problemeither among the earliset muslim generations. The 3 first muslimgenerations were the best generation as the prophet (S) said.Pleasetell us how it goes.

It is natural that you feel resentment towards yourhusband and his girlfriend for your miscarriage. You even want to killhis former girlfriend. I think you have to understand the gravity ofyour statement. Allah has decreed that killing one person is likekilling the whole humankind, including yourself, your family and allthose you love. killing is only permitted in jihad, retaliation byshari'ah for murder, etc.So let Allah deal with whoevertrangresses beyond bounds. He is the best who retributor and justpunisher, the best judge. I think you should repent and ask Allah forforgiveness, for even thinking and intending to kill a person unjustly.You should also understand that your miscarriage was decreed byAllah the all wise, for reasons He knows best. Maybe so that you becomeeven closer to Him, and that he forgives you for your suffering, andlove you and reward you if you respond to the situation without doingwrong, eventhough wrong had been done to you. Realise that nomatter what was done, seeing the best doctors, etc the miscarriage wasgoing to take place, and if Allah willed, no matter what the suffering,the baby would have been born, even if you have no intercourse.

But really the problem with Zinah of all sorts, minor ormajor stem from a root. Think about it, we live in a society werepeople see all sorts of nudity and rubbish on TV, on the streets, inmagazines, and where not? Then we expect people to act like saints! Wehave to tackle the problem from the root. Your brother could bewatching bad TV programs that influence him to do such things, whereideas that people should satisfy their sexual desires at all cost arepromoted, there are even talk shows that host family members that havecommitted incense, like in one instance, i heard about sexual relationsbetween a father and a daughter, and then these people come out on TVand say how they actually had fun. can you imagine! Your brother couldbe hanging around with bad friends, etc. So try and find outthe root of the problem. Your brother did not develop a physical desirefor you overnight. Then try and tackle this problem with your family,your parents. All avenues that lead him to do it such as TV, magazines,bad friends should be restricted for him and substitutes found for him,i.e. buy him islamic tapes to watch, find good friends for him, supporthim and help him, explain to him the gravity of the act he commited.And dont expect him to change overnight too, it should be gradual.Insha Allah he will be guided by Allah to the straight path.

To busy with school and slow internet.Thebasic advice has already been given to you, which you've alreadycarried out, istikharah, alhamdulillah for istikharah prayers.Butthen i guess you still probably want more advice. Most times we peoplewould like advice, help and support eventhough we might know theexpected advice, or have heard it atleast.So my advice to you, which i am pretty sure you've heard already is this.Theprophet (S) said it is forbidden for a muslim brother to propose to amuslim sister that another muslim brother has already proposed to,unless he gets permission from the brother who proposed first to goahead. In your case, it seems like person A proposed first then personB came in. I'm not sure whether person B got permission from person Ato propose to you. If he didn't, then i think proposal of person B isinvalid and you should not consider him unless person A allows him topropose. You have to deal with person A first and alone, and try andsee if it could work out. If and only when it doesn't work out, thenyou can consider another proposal, of course after agreeing with personA that there is no prospect of marriage between both of you.Ifpeople follow the guidelines Islam lays out, then marriages will benice and smooth, with no grudges beteen muslims, and no parties envyingeach other and making marriages competitions like winning girlfriendsin western societies.Even if person A permits person B topropose to you, i think for the sake of making things easy, nice andsimple, you could kindly tell person B you someone has proposed to youand he could only propose to you when it doesn't work out with personB. i am trying to condemn person B, he could even be a betterperson to Allah than person A, Allah knows best but take it one at atime.Another reminder to you is the hadith of the prophet (S),which he said a woman is married for 4 reasons. Her beauty, her wealth,her character and her reputation. Then the prophet (S) went on to say,marry the religious one.To me this means that the firstcriteria is to check the deen and character of the partner, for this isthe basis of all marriages. Consider all other things like beauty,reputation, etc but do not give them to much importance and weigh themheavily.Some muslims make the mistake of looking for beautyfirst, then the deen and character. The beauty then covers their eyesso that they overlook the other more important things, an as we can seetoday everywhere, the results of these kind of marriages. I trust you to be good in choosing the right husband due to your knowlegde and experience in IF.Sister,i hope i have been of great help and may Allah give you a pious husbandwith other good things you would like from him.

I said fasting hasn't helped me much.Astagafirillah, now i have to take my word back.To say thetruth, i never understood how fasting could be a substitute before onegets married and i have to admit, i didn't actually believe fastingcould be a substitute. Even though i fast, like on mondays andthursdays, i never did one based on the advice of the prophet (S).Butthen, Allah is great. Just yesterday, when i fasted, i believe irealised the wisdom behind the prophet 's(S) saying. I felt a certaindevotion to Allah that made me focus on doing what i wanted to do. Ifelt a shield that prevented evil thoughts coming into my head. I feltcloser to Allah. I think the lack of food is what promoted all this.The need for food in the body is greater than the need on anythingelse, including all other desires that Allah gave us. So without thisfood, one is more likely to think only about Allah and food for thewhole day. I don't know how to explain better what i felt yesterday and what i realised. Alesson i learned from this is, how much we believe in something willdetermine how much it will help us. And because Allah is great,sometimes we do not really believe in something because we do notunderstand it, but out of his mercy, Allah sometimes helps us out. Ma'assalam",988,27,I Think I Feel Lonely,16:20:00,2/8/05,24"<!--QuoteBegin-Batoota+Feb 8 2005, 04:31 PM--",988,27,I Think I Feel Lonely,16:47:00,2/8/05,25"Assalamu alaykum sister in Islam,Ihave seen so many variety ways of spelling my name 'Farouk' but yourspelling of mine name seems very weird 'Farouke' :biggrin: .

My question is: What is the best way tomemorize the QurØ£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an? Can you also outline a schedule as to howto do it? After memorizing one Juz' does one need to revise the onememorized before moving forward? Jazakum Allah khayran. Name of MuftiIslam Online Fatwa Editing Desk Content of Reply Wa`alykum As-Salaamu Warahmatullahi Wabarakaatuh. In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. Dearbrother in Islam, thank you very much for your question which showsyour great concern for the Book of Allah, the Glorious Qur'an. Weimplore Almighty Allah to help you accomplish the task of memorizing itand earning the great reward that lies in store for whoever memorizesand adheres to its teachings, Amen. First of all, weØ£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢dlike to state that there is a great merit in memorizing theQurØ£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an and teaching it. The Prophet, peace and blessings be uponhim, says in this regard: ""The best amongst you is the one who learnsthe Qur'an and teaches it."" (Reported by Al-Bukhari). AlsoAbdullah bin `Amr ibn al-`As quotes Allah's Messenger, peace andblessings be upon him, as saying: ""It will be said to the one who hadmemorized the Qur'an [and acted upon it]: 'Recite the Qur'an (ascendingthe levels of Paradise thereby) and do so slowly and melodiously justas you used to recite slowly and melodiously in the world since yourabode will be at the place where you finish reciting your last verse.""You see now that one earns tremendous reward in committing the Qur'anto heart, acting upon it and conveying its message to others. Asregard your question, first of all, it's important to tell you thatcertain rules and methods should be applied in memorizing theQurØ£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an so as to get the expected fruits. Thus, we would like topresent some of these rules which will assist you in memorizing theQur'an, may Allah benefit all of us by them. In doing so, we will firstshed some light on two perquisites for the act of memorizing theQurØ£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an and then elaborate on some practical steps to befollowed. A- Two Perquisites for the Act of Memorizing the QurØ£Â¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an: 1- Having Pure Intention: Whetherin memorizing the Qur'an or doing anything for Allah, a most importantobligation is to purify the intention and correct the goal. Thus, one'sconcern to memorize Qur'an and preserve it must be secured for Allah,the Sublime and Exalted, for gaining His Paradise and attaining HisPleasure, and for acquiring the great rewards that are reserved forthose who recite the Qur'an and memorize it. Therefore, there is noreward for one who recites the Qur'an or memorizes it for people'ssake: to show off and to be heard of. 2- Having a Truthful and Firm Resolution to Memorize it: Aperson should have such an intent when commencing the task ofmemorizing the Qur'an, in the midst of it and even after it when oneneeds to return to what one has memorized in order to preserve it inhis memory. Without this firm resolution a person will treat the wholematter lightly, will become tired easily and will not even be able toachieve his goal. One of the ways a person develops a firmintent is to know the excellence of the Qur'an and to aspire after thereward mentioned above, and yearn drawing close to Allah through thatact of worship. B- Practical Steps for Memorizing the Qur'an: 1- Correcting Pronunciation and Recitation: Thefirst step in memorizing the Qur'an is to correct the pronunciation.This cannot be fulfilled unless one listens to a good and precisereciter or memorizer of the Qur'an. The Qur'an cannot be learnedwithout a teacher. Allah's Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him,was the most eloquent of all the Arabs. Yet, he learnt the Qur'an fromAngel Jibreel (Gabriel) orally. Also the Messenger, peace and blessingsbe upon him, used to recite the Qur'an to Jibreel once in every year -in Ramadan. And in the year that he died, he recited it to him twice. Likewise,Allah's Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, taught the Qur'anto his Companions orally; and he heard it from them, after they hadlearned it from him, time and again. Therefore, one isrequired to learn the Qur'an from a good reciter, to correct one'srecitation on a first basis. Also, one should not rely solely ononeself in learning the recitation of the Qur'an, even if one isknowledgeable of the Arabic language and its principles. This is sobecause in the Qur'an there are many verses that occur in a wayuncommon in the rules of the Arabic language. 2- Adhering to a daily Limit for Memorizing the Qur'an: Onemust set a daily limit for some verses of Surahs (Chapters) of theQur'an that one wishes to memorize. This limit should be reasonable andpossible to fulfill. It varies in its amount from one person toanother. One should resist the temptation to move to a newportion of the Qur'an before perfecting the memorization of the currentportion that agrees with the set limit. This is a disciplinary measurethat helps one concentrate on one thing at a time, reducinginterruption, and enabling one to firmly establish one's currentportion in one's mind. 3- Continual Recitation and Revision: Onceone has corrected one's recitation and set one's daily limit, oneshould begin his memorization process by continual recitation andrepetition of one's daily portion. The memorizer must occupy himself with this through the hours of the day and night. He should recite it: -in the Fard (obligatory) as well the Nafl (optional) prayers, -while sitting in the Masjid (mosque) awaiting the Jama'ah (congregational) prayer, -for a few minutes after the Jama'ah prayer, -before going to sleep, -while waiting for anything (bus, dentist, etc.), -while riding a bus, car, etc. Inthis way, it is possible for a person to practice his memorization evenwhen occupied with other matters, because one is not restricted to justone specific time for memorizing the Qur'an. And with approach of nightone will find that one's set limit is memorized and firmly establishedin one's mind. And if something unusual happens to occupy the memorizerduring the day, preventing him from completing the set limit, oneshould not move onto the next portion of the Qur'an on the followingday. Rather, one should continue with what one had started the daybefore, until the memorization is perfected. 4- Reciting in a Melodic Tone: Duringmemorization, one should recite the Qur'an in a melodic tone,beautifying the reading as much as possible. It is important the onereads melodically because of the following reasons: a) Melodicrecitation conforms with the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace and blessingsbe upon him, who used to recite the Qur'an in a melodious and tranquilmanner. <img src=""all%20posts%20by%20FAROUK1986%20-%20page8_files/cool.gif"" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" border=""0"" alt=""cool.gif"" emoid=""B)"" /",846,21,Remembering What You Have Memorised,21:56:00,2/17/05,81"Assalamu AlaykumManyof you probably know French Connection UK (FCUK).

Recite Ayatul Kursiyyu, that is surah 2 (Baqarah) ayat 255everyday. It is like a shield and protection. Also recite 3 timeseachsurat Nas, falaq and Ikhlas, that is surat 114, 113 and 112. Thereis none like them as the prophet (s) said.I'm happy to hearyour trying hard to be a good muslim, and this has made you lonely andlose friends. That was my problem too when i came to IF. What you needis someone to talk to right? but its hard to dind one. You can tryislamic centers, masjid... You can contact me MSN if you want to talkas your feeling lonely by adding me contact umarm21[at]hotmail.com. Youcan hang around in the forums in IF, they could be very beneficial andhelpful.About the problems with your family, i advise you tostay patient and stick to Islam.

If anyI visited Egypt roughly 2 years ago. Itwas a lovely trip! advice for anyone visiting egypt, don't use thelocal camels to go the pyramid!!! Can you imagine, they priced the tripto the pyramid at about 500 Egyptian pounds- long tour, 350 medium tourand about 200 short tour. They even said out of 'kindness' they willtake us on a medium tour for the price of short.The funny thingis, from the location we set off with the camels, we could see thepyramid, but they took we went on camel and horse back into the desert,then back near the set off location to the pyramids. Of course theyknew we will be tired and thirsty on the way, so they took care of thatby making us buy Turbans and cold drinks on the way. It's not like wehad a choice!!! it was blazing hot and from nowhere, one will be handeda chilling coke bottle.Then by the time we arrived to thepyramids, the sphinx, they knew we will be too exhausted and hence theywill not need to give us a tour kind of talk!!! We spent hours to thepyramid, then like magic on the way back, we were back in the locationwe set off in just a few minutes!B4 all that, our tour guidetook us to a so called museum, 'The papyrus..' something. We went in,and they allowed us to go in for 'free' as they said. I was surprisedhow small the museum was, with no mummies or anything like that, butfull of papyrus portraits. they even offered us 'free drinks' and gaveus a short history about the 'museum and papyru'. Then they wentstraight to business and said, now which papyrus portraits are youbuying. It was a shop not a museum after all!!! we were expected to buyatleast something for their 'hospitality'. Then our tour guidesaid he would take us to the 'Grand Bazaar'. He took us to a localcorner shop, and we only realised how fixed the prices were when welater went to a market.What about the great stuff in Egypt???Hmm, Sheraton Cairo we lodged in was great!!! The food, espcially thebreakfast and the morrocan restaurant.The malls were not bad,considering we were in Africa!!!Ice skating and the nile cruise weregreat. Visit to Al-Azhar was great too.Actually we went toEgypt bcos i planned to go to school there. I badly wanted to learnarabic (and still badly want to learn it) so i decided to school inEgypt. I went over to American University cairo, but didn't want tostay there. I went to Al-azhar see if i can get to study arabic for ayear, then buzz off. We got to meet the Big Sheikh of al-azhar, and hesaid i could come on scholarship. We met a guy who was suppose toassist me back in me homecountry, nut when we went back he was neverthere!!! so the arrangements looked dodgy, and now here i am, in apre-university course- The International Baccaulareate (IB). I don'tplan to go to study in egypt anymore, but insha Allah i plan to studyarabic by the side to whichever university i go.Hope you enjoyed the story of me trip to Egypt!!! <img src=""all%20posts%20by%20FAROUK1986%20-%20page7_files/biggrin.gif"" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" border=""0"" alt=""biggrin.gif"" emoid="":D"" /",9147,73,"  <a href=""http://www.gawaher.com/index.php?showtopic=1306&amp;hl=""",19:20:00,2/21/05,121"Assalamu Alaykum^^^Great quote brother. i don't think i ever heard that. Jazakallahu bikhair.Ma'assalam",846,21,Remembering What You Have Memorised,19:46:00,2/21/05,122"Assalamu Alaykum,You guys made me laugh , the way you were concerned about watching football. <img src=""all%20posts%20by%20FAROUK1986%20-%20page7_files/laugh.gif"" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" border=""0"" alt=""laugh.gif"" emoid="":lol:"" /",9619,497,Football,19:59:00,2/21/05,123"<!--QuoteBegin-Rahim+Feb 21 2005, 08:14 PM--",9619,497,Football,20:46:00,2/21/05,124"Assalamu AlaykumAllahuAkbar.

This happened 3 times i think and the same person keptturning up. So the companions tried to find out why this person is aman of paradise. One of the companions spent time with him to find out.This man of paradise, slept through the night, and didn't do anythingspecial that people could see. So thr companion investigating gave upand told the man of paradise that he has been observing his actionsbecause of what the prophet (S) said, and asked the man of paradisewhat he does that is special. The man of paradise told him he doesn'tknow but he does something every night before he goes to bed. Before hegoes to bed he forgives everybody for what they did to him hoping thatAllah also forgives him for what he has done.When A shocolartold me this hadith, i said to myself, why not forgive Bush forinvading muslim lands and killing my muslim brothers and sisters, allthe people who oppress the muslims and all people who do me wrong, forsurely, Allah's torment is enough for them if they don't repentsincerely, i don't need to add more torment on them.

Saying 'Oh its going to be fun', 'you'll miss if you don'tgo'....Guys in my school talk and plan what they will do for theirproms years in advance, organising their dates, cars, suits and whatnot. My answer to this is, be patient. You will never lose outif you remember Allah and decide not to do something for his sake. Thereward will be immense. Atleast if the prom is not haram, it isdoubtful and keep away from what you are in doubt with to what yourcomfortable with, what you can happily do while everyone is watchingyou , especially Allah. Brother Lailaha-illah, about yourfriend, don't forsake him. Show him with wisdom that what he did orwhat he is doing is haram. If he doesn't listen or keeps on arguing heis right to do what he is doing, then leave him alone and close thatchapter by ending that discussion. Remember the prophet (S) said iguarantee paradise to someone who stops an argument even if they knowthey are right.And trust me brother, don't be sad, you will seepeople doing so much wrong. You just occupy yourself with what Allahwill hold you account for, and leave people to account with Allah fortheir own. If an opportunity rises to show them with wisdom that theyare doing wrong, then take it and do it without intense arguments. Ma'assalam",628,23,Ball/prom,20:57:00,5/7/05,191"Assalamu Alaykumiwas really happy to hear this story.

Realise you have a choice toforgive and not to forgive. I think to realise you have a choice, andto choose the choice to forgive which is better will make it easier.Always remember you have a choice. If you choose to forgive, rememberyou could have chosen otherwise.Looking at the forgiven side, iadvice you to read over the story of Yusuf (AS)in the Quran. Theywanted to kill him and basically got rid of him. But he forgave them.Read the story, try to understand how bad it was to him that hisbrother's threw him into a well.Read the biography of theprophet (S). Reflect on what the quraish did to him and how he forgavethem. How the people of Ta'if stoned him and how he forgave them.Youwill be a million, kazillion....times better off forgiving somebody. Ifyou do not forgive the person, and he does not repent and ask you toforgive, the person will be punished, no question. And admittedlyeveryone likes to see payback. But to forgive, in akhirah when yourjust looking for that extra reward, rewards from the people who didwrong to you will be added to yours and you will be so happy youforgave the person, or your sins will be added to the person.Iknow what you say when it hurts badly when the memory comes. What i dois i say to myself, if this person is a good person, he will repent andask me to forgive, or atleast attempt to ask me to forgive, but maybecouldn't due to lack of contact or something like that. But if theperson is bad, then even if i forgive or not, the person will still bepunished for their other sins. Meanwhile by forgiving, i gain. Allahhas mercy on me, forgives me for sins which i know and don't know,considering the fact that it is very likely i have also done somethingto someone which requires the person to forgive me, or else i'll bepunished.",794,24,Forgiveness For Someone That Hurt You,16:19:00,5/9/05,200"Cont'd...Have you read this hadith;Theprophet (S) and companions were in a Masjid when he (S) said, theperson that is about to come in is a man of paradise. Then a man camein. This man was no one special in terms of doing nawafil prayers,night prayers, fasting etc. So the companions were surprised. The nextday the same thing happened and the same man popped into the Masjidafter the prophet (S) the next man to come in is a man of paradise. Sonow the companions were really curious and one of them decided tosecretly find out what this man does to deserve paradise. A companionstayed over night in his house and observed nothing special so he justadmitted why he stayed overnight to the man, The man said he also doesnot know why. But there is something he does everynight before he goesto bed, he does not keep anyone in his heart. He forgives anything thathas been done to him. This earned him paradise.So if you alwaysforgive others, the cycle will be such that others will also forgiveyou and the All forgiving Alllah will forgive you. If sometimes shaitantries to remind you of past experiences that hurt, seek refuge withAllah from him. Do something that will make you forget like tasbih,dhikr, reading the quran, having a conversation with somebody else on abeneficial topic.May Allah erase those terrible memories of yours and make it easy for you to forgive, as well as all of us.

The prophet (S) was alive and people were eaten khubz(basically bread). He was alive when alcohol was consumed and heforbade it. The one that buys it, carries it, sits where it is drank,drinking it...anything directly related to alcohol was forbidden. SoAllah in his infinite wisdom and knowledge knew how bread was made butit was not forbidden. Alcohol meanwhile was. So no matter how we try toexplain it, Allah knows best.I would explain it by saying, sothat people will not start to become careless about it and because itis a major sin, to show how serious it is the avoid it at all costs. bybuying alcohol and using it to flavor food, it will reach a stage whenthe alcohol will be at easy reach for those who want to consume it,even in muslim countries. So anybody buying alcohol, 'oh i use it onlywhen cooking'. And with children and naive peolple around, they mightwant to try out this 'special ingredient that mom only uses to makespecial meals'.Also in the hadith forbiden alcohol, it forbidsa muslim to sit on the table where it is consumed. Why? is it becauseit evaporates and the muslim inhales it and eventually becomesintoxicated? Unlikely but possible. It is so that people don't even getattracted to it, be tempted to take it, and people to shun altogetheranything that has to do with it. Mixing alcohol with food is comingeven closer than sitting on a table where it is consumed. The personbuys it, holds the bottle, smells it, uses it and this is even worsethan sitting on the table where it is consumed, eventhough it wasn'tconsumed as it evaporated while cooking.Hope this helps and jazakallah bikhairma'assalam",366,6,Cooking With Alcohol,12:04:00,5/11/05,214"<!--QuoteBegin-isha+May 10 2005, 12:54 AM--",736,20,Is It True.........................?,12:31:00,5/11/05,215"Assalamu alaykumOh yeah, i forgot to ask.

Especially as hijab by consensus of majorityof scholars is an obligation, and the prophet (S) said the ummah willnever be wrong if they come to a consensus on an issue.But ifshe is not wearing it for reasons like, after post 9/11 bla bla bla...,its too hot, its not beautiful.....then i will rather pick someone else.Theonly time i think its worth to give benefit of a doubt is if the issueis not decisively agreed in consensus by scholars, i.e.obligatory ofniqaab.wasalam",740,25,Rejecting A Muslimah?!,17:45:00,1/10/06,270"Assalamu alaykumIsuggest you do more research whether hijab is an obligation or notSister Dabenzine.
