The next report will be issued on or around 13 January 2010.A powerful earthquake of 7.0 magnitude (USGS) on the Richter Scale affected Haiti on 12 January, at 16.53hrs local time (GMT 21.53hrs). The earthquake happened 17km south-west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti (18.45N, 72.45W). Initial reports suggest a high number of casualties and widespread damage, with an urgent need for Search and Rescue.A United Nations Disaster and Assessment coordination Team (UNDAC) is being mobilized.                               II. Situation OverviewOn Tuesday 12 January, at approximately 16.53hrs local time, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the RichterScale, and less than 10 km deep, was recorded off the coast of Haiti, and only 17 km from the capital, Port-au-Prince. Aftershocks have been felt measuring 5.9 and 5.5 respectively. More aftershocks are expected inthe coming hours.The mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective andprincipled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.The capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, has been severely affected including critical city infrastructurecomponents such as, electricity, water and phone services. Electricity is not available and communicationsare difficult. Initial reports indicate a large number of casualties and widespread damage.At this stage there is very limited access because of debris and other obstacles on the roads. The airport ofPort-au-Prince is reported to be closed. The Presidential Palace and Government buildings are reported tohave been seriously damaged. According to preliminary reports, several UN and well as other nationalbuildings have collapsed or have been damaged. Populations may also be affected in Carrefour and Jacmel. United Nations agencies, as well as the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societyare preparing the deployment of teams and humanitarian assistance, notably from their regional hub inPanama. USAID/OFDA is sending a response team in addition to 2 USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) heavyteams.OCHA is mobilizing a United Nations Disaster and Assessment Coordination Team (UNDAC) and isdeploying staff from its Regional Office in Panama.There has been no immediate report of damage in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Tsunami alerts werelifted, including for Haiti.III. Humanitarian Needs and ResponseEvacuation of injured, medical supplies and expertise are needed. Also clean water may be urgently neededvery soon.IV. FundingAll humanitarian partners including donors and recipient agencies are encouraged to inform FTS of cash andin-kind contributions by sending an email to: fts@reliefweb.int.V.

This plate boundary is dominated by left-lateral strike slip motion and compression, and accommodates about 20 mm/y slip, with the Caribbean plate moving eastward with respect to the North America plate.Haiti occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola, one of the Greater Antilles islands, situated between Puerto Rico and Cuba. At the longitude of the January 12 earthquake, motion between the Caribbean and North American plates is partitioned between two major east-west trending, strike-slip fault systems -- the Septentrional fault system in northern Haiti and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system in southern Haiti.The location and focal mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred as left-lateral strike slip faulting on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system. This fault system accommodates about 7 mm/y, nearly half the overall motion between the Caribbean plate and North America plate.The Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system has not produced a major earthquake in recent decades. The EPGFZ is the likely source of historical large earthquakes in 1860, 1770, 1761, 1751, 1684, 1673, and 1618, though none of these has been confirmed in the field as associated with this fault.",18.465589,-72.412499,1,0,1e,Earthquake and aftershocks212,Need Help with Crowd Control,1/14/10 3:46,christ-roi rue mayard at the base,getting people out of the hospital,18.54085,-72.316313,1,0,1,Emergency255,Becky DeWine School Damaged in Cite Soleil,1/14/10 1:29,Cite Soleil,Becky DeWine School in the Port-au-Prince slum known as Cite Soleil have been damaged but not demolished,18.578491,-72.335553,1,0,2a,Structures at risk280,MSF operating theatre in Cite Soleil,1/14/10 8:10,Cite Soleil,"An MSF team is beginning to work in the operating theater of a major public hospital in the capital’s Cite Soleil district, 1,000 patients have received care in the four tented facilities MSF set up near the damaged buildings.",18.578491,-72.335553,1,0,4,Response326,Functioning Hospital in Cite Soleil WITH WATER,1/15/10 11:02,cite soleil hospital,water is being trucked to functioning hospital in Cite Soleil,18.578491,-72.335553,1,0,4a,Health services397,Burst water pipe,1/15/10 3:53,"Cite Soleil, Haiti","Just outside Cite Soleil slum, desperate people crowded around a burst water pipe jostling to drink from the pipe or fill up buckets.",18.577918,-72.334843,1,0,1,Emergency197,Cite Soleil - Situation,1/14/10 3:04,"Cite Soleil, Haiti","Cite Soleil church and Repatriate churches non-functional, church compounds (Cite Soleil and Blanchard) are being used as places of refuge, away from the danger of any houses and trees that could fall on the people.
